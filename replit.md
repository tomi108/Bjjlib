# Video Library Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack video library management application built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The application allows users to organize, browse, and manage video content with tagging capabilities. It features a modern UI built with shadcn/ui components and follows a clean monorepo architecture with shared schemas between client and server.

## Recent Changes

**October 5, 2025 - High-Resolution Thumbnails with Dark Border Detection:**
- **Updated thumbnail quality system**: All videos now use high-resolution `maxresdefault.jpg` (1280x720) as primary source
- Universal fallback chain for optimal quality and reliability:
  1. `maxresdefault.jpg` (1280x720) - Primary for ALL videos (regular and Shorts)
  2. `sddefault.jpg` (640x480) - First fallback for better quality
  3. `hqdefault.jpg` (480x360) - Second fallback
  4. `hq2.jpg` (frame-based) - Last resort for Shorts/verticals only
  5. SVG placeholder with play icon - Final fallback for complete failures
- Eliminates fuzzy thumbnails by prioritizing highest available resolution
- Added `isYouTubeShort()` detection function that checks for `/shorts/` in URL
- **Server-Side Pixel Analysis for Dark Border Detection (âœ… WORKING)**: 
  - Created `/api/analyze-thumbnail` endpoint using Sharp.js for accurate pixel-based detection
  - Bypasses CORS restrictions by fetching and analyzing images server-side
  - Security: URL validation with hostname whitelist (YouTube/Vimeo CDNs only), SSRF protection
  - Algorithm: Downsample to 25%, sample RGB columns every 5px (min 10 samples per column)
  - **Universal dark border detection** - detects ANY very dark borders regardless of color:
    - `brightness < 50` (average of RGB channels) - catches all dark pixels including colored ones
    - OR `maxChannel < 60 AND channelDiff < 15` - backup detection for near-black/gray pixels
  - Column detection: Requires 65% of column pixels to be dark (tolerates partial occlusion from video content)
  - Successfully detects black, gray, AND dark colored borders (e.g., dark blue letterbox bars)
  - Prevents false positives on lighter colored content (blue BJJ mats, dark backgrounds)
  - Returns left/right bar percentages; frontend applies clipPath + scale transform if >5% total bars
  - In-memory caching prevents re-analysis of same thumbnails
  - **Verified working on multiple border types**:
    - "Open guard - Armbar from knee on belly": Black/gray borders (28.3% each side) âœ…
    - "Test YouTube Short": Dark blue borders RGB(3,1,38) (29.2% each side) âœ…
- Updated container styling from inline `paddingBottom: "56.25%"` to Tailwind `aspect-[16/9]` class
- Removed problematic `scale-[2.2]` zoom class, added `block` class to images
- System successfully detects and crops baked-in black/gray letterbox bars from video thumbnails
- Maintains aspect ratio and image quality through CSS transforms after cropping

**October 5, 2025 - TypeScript Error Fixes:**
- Fixed TypeScript errors in VideoCard component
- Updated VideoCard to use `VideoWithTags` type instead of `Video` type to properly support tags
- Removed non-existent `description` field from VideoCard component
- Fixed tag rendering to work with Tag objects (`tag.name`) instead of strings
- All LSP diagnostics resolved, application fully functional

**October 3, 2025 - Database and Authentication Updates:**

**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL DATABASE FIX - Production Data Loss Issue Resolved:**
- **Problem**: Application was using SQLite file storage in both development and production
- **Impact**: Railway deployments created fresh database on each deploy, causing complete data loss
- **Solution**: Implemented multi-database support:
  - **Development (Replit)**: Uses SQLite (`bjjlib.db` file) for fast local development
  - **Production (Railway)**: Uses PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL (persistent, scalable storage)
- **Technical Details**:
  - Added dual schema support in `shared/schema.ts` (SQLite + PostgreSQL table definitions)
  - Updated `server/db.ts` to detect environment and select appropriate database driver
  - Refactored `server/storage.ts` to use dialect-neutral Drizzle ORM methods
  - Database selection based on `NODE_ENV=production` + `DATABASE_URL` presence
- **Deployment**: Push to GitHub â†’ Railway auto-deploys with PostgreSQL â†’ Data persists âœ…

**Admin Panel Edit Button:**
- Added edit button (pencil icon) to Admin Panel video table for quick access to edit page
- Complements existing edit buttons on video cards for improved workflow

**Authentication UI Redesign:**
- Removed tabbed navigation (Browse/Admin tabs) from the homepage
- Video library content is now always visible to all users
- Login functionality moved to a dialog modal accessed via header button
- Admin features accessible through an "Admin Panel" button for logged-in users
- Login/Logout buttons conditionally displayed in the header based on authentication status

**Per-Video Edit Functionality:**
- Added edit button (pencil icon) to each video card, visible only to logged-in admins
- Clicking edit button navigates to dedicated edit page at `/edit/:id`
- Edit page allows admins to modify video title and manage tags (add/remove)
- Video URL is displayed but non-editable for data integrity
- All video mutation endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE) now require admin authentication
- Unauthorized edit attempts return 401 status with appropriate error messages

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- shadcn/ui component library based on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens

**Design Decisions:**
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom components for domain logic (`video-card`, `video-form`, `tag-manager`, `video-table`, `admin-tab`)
- Form validation using React Hook Form with Zod resolvers for type-safe form handling
- Query client configured with infinite stale time to minimize unnecessary refetches
- Path aliases configured for clean imports (`@/`, `@shared/`, `@assets/`)
- Authentication state managed through React Query with cookie-based sessions
- Admin features conditionally rendered based on session state

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Express.js as the web framework
- Node.js with ES modules (type: "module")
- TypeScript for type safety across the stack
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- In-memory storage implementation with interface pattern for easy swapping

**Design Decisions:**
- RESTful API design with conventional endpoints (`/api/videos`, `/api/tags`, `/api/health`, `/api/admin/*`)
- Storage abstraction through `IStorage` interface allows switching between in-memory and database implementations
- Request/response logging middleware for API debugging
- Schema validation using Zod schemas derived from Drizzle tables
- Health check endpoint for monitoring application status
- Cookie-based session management for admin authentication using httpOnly cookies

### Database Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- PostgreSQL as the primary database (configured via Neon serverless driver)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations

**Schema Design:**
- `videos` table: Stores video metadata (title, URL, description, tags array, timestamps)
- `tags` table: Manages tag taxonomy with video counts
- `admin_sessions` table: Stores admin session data for authentication
- UUID primary keys generated via PostgreSQL's `gen_random_uuid()`
- Array column type for video tags enabling many-to-many relationships without join tables
- Automatic timestamp generation for creation dates

**Design Rationale:**
- Array-based tags simplify queries while maintaining flexibility
- Tag count denormalization improves read performance for tag popularity features
- Shared schema definitions between client and server eliminate type mismatches

### Development Environment

**Build System:**
- Vite for frontend bundling with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- esbuild for backend compilation in production builds
- tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- Separate build outputs: `dist/public` for frontend, `dist` for backend

**Replit Integration:**
- Runtime error overlay plugin for better debugging
- Cartographer plugin for code navigation (development only)
- Dev banner plugin for environment awareness (development only)

**Configuration:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled across the project
- Path resolution configured for monorepo structure
- ESM-first module resolution strategy

### Notes on Architecture
- The application currently uses an in-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage` class) but is structured to easily switch to database-backed storage through the `IStorage` interface
- Database configuration is present and ready for PostgreSQL integration via the Neon serverless driver
- Admin authentication uses cookie-based sessions with ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable for security
- The monorepo structure with shared schemas ensures type consistency between frontend and backend

## Authentication System

**Backend:**
- Three endpoints: `/api/admin/login`, `/api/admin/logout`, `/api/admin/session`
- Cookie-based session management using httpOnly cookies for security
- Sessions stored in memory (via `IStorage` interface) with 24-hour expiration
- Password validated against `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable

**Frontend:**
- React Query fetches admin status on page load
- Login dialog accessible via header button for non-authenticated users
- Admin Panel button appears for authenticated admins to access management features
- Logout button replaces login button after successful authentication
- Full page reload after login/logout to refresh session state

**Security Notes:**
- ADMIN_PASSWORD must be configured in environment variables for authentication to work
- Sessions use httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks
- Secure flag enabled for cookies in production environments
